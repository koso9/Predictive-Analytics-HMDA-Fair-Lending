# **Analyzing Racial Disparities in Mortgage Approvals Using HMDA Data**

## **üìä Overview**
This project uses the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) dataset to explore whether racial and ethnic factors influence mortgage approval outcomes. By combining **regulatory data** with Python analytics, the project aims to identify potential disparities in lending practices.

---

## **üí° Why It Matters**
Understanding the role of race in mortgage approvals is critical for:
- **Fair Lending Practices**: Ensuring equal opportunities for all applicants.
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Assisting lenders in meeting federal anti-discrimination standards.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Using statistical models to uncover systemic issues.

This project highlights expertise in **financial data analysis**, **regulatory datasets**, and **predictive modeling**.

## **‚ú® Key Features**
### **1. HMDA Data Integration**
- Fetches live HMDA data via the CFPB API for specified institutions and years.
- Loads data into a structured format for analysis.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Examines race and ethnicity distributions for applicants and co-applicants.
- Analyzes loan approval rates across different racial groups.

### **3. Predictive Modeling**
